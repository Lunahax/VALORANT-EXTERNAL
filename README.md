#### QUICK NOTES
- PROVIDED LOADER IN RELEASES DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT EXCLUSIVE KEY
- Published source code is **NOT** 100% functional and was only partially made by me ([Credits](#lw)).
- The public source code is only a part of the entire project.
- [Contact me](#discord) if you need help or want it to work.
- This is the only real VAL0ADER repository, any other one is [fake](#skids)!
