## <a id="installation"></a>📂 〢 Installation

1. Under the [Releases](https://github.com/Lunahax/VALORANT-EXTERNAL/releases) tab, check for the latest version.

2. Once you've found the latest version, click on it.

3. Read the release notes, there might be important information.

4. Now check for the attached files. You should find 3-4 files, 2 of them named `Source Code` - These are the files you will **NOT** need to download. Instead, look for a file named `VALORANT-EXTERNAL.zip` or `VALORANT-EXTERNAL.rar`.

5. Click on the files named `VALORANT-EXTERNAL` and they should download right away.

6. If any `.zip` or `.rar` files were attached, extract these files in the same folder where you can find your `Riot Games` folder (do not extract into the Riot Games folder!).

7. Launch VALORANT and head into the Training Range.

8. Disable Rawinputbuffer and set window mode to Windowed Fullscreen.

9. Launch the extracted `cheat-menu.exe`.

10. Adjust your settings and hit save to start injection.

11. Have fun!
