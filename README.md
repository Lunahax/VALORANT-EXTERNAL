## <a id="pre"></a>🌙 〢 Prerequisites

You will need:
- An own mouse driver **OR** a registered version of VEMD
- A software or website to extract `.zip` or `.rar` files

---

## <a id="sys"></a>💻 〢 System requirements
> VALORANT-EXTERNAL will have a noticable performance impact on your game as we didn't manage to optimize it yet

To play on medium settings with 144+ fps you should have:
- A GPU which is decent enough to play the game on high settings with at least 120 fps (such as a GTX 1050Ti or RX 560/570)
- A CPU fast enough to handle 2 high usage processes at a decent speed (such as a Ryzen 5 1600 or i5-7600

A specific RAM size is not required but 8(+)GB (DDR4(+); 3200(+)MHz) is recommended.

---

## <a id="com"></a>📎 〢 Compability

VALORANT-EXTERNAL is only compatible with:
- Windows 10 (a specific version is not required)

---

## <a id="installation"></a>📂 〢 Installation

1. Under the [Releases](https://github.com/Lunahax/VALORANT-EXTERNAL/releases) tab, check for the latest version.

2. Once you've found the latest version, click on it.

3. Read the release notes, there might be important information.

4. Now check for the attached files. You should find 3-4 files, 2 of them named `Source Code` - These are the files you will **NOT** need to download. Instead, look for a file named `VALORANT-EXTERNAL.zip` or `VALORANT-EXTERNAL.rar`.

5. Click on the files named `VALORANT-EXTERNAL` and they should download right away.

6. If any `.zip` or `.rar` files were attached, extract these files.

7. Once extracted, you should see multiple files. One of them should be named `README.txt`, `Installation.txt` or similar. Open that file.

8. You should now see a further installation guide which will instruct you your final steps.

---

## <a id="setup"></a>⚙️ 〢 Setup

1. Once you've installed everything successfully, you should see an `.exe` file in your extracted folder. Running it will open a menu with many options to choose from. Adjust everything after your liking and hit the `Save` button! The window should remain open.

2. Now, in your game, head into the `General Settings` and disable `[Beta] RawInputBuffer` and under `Video Settings`, set `Window Mode` to `Windowed Fullscreen`.

And now you're good to go!

---

## <a id="usage"></a>☄️ 〢 Usage

Setup done? Great! Now launch your game and hop into a game!
> We recommend to head into the range earlier to test & review your configuration
